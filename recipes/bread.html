    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Activate Yeast: In a bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>Mix Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and melted butter (if using). Stir until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead Dough: Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>First Rise: Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Shape Loaf: Punch down the dough, shape it into a loaf, and place it in a greased 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Second Rise: Cover and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes until puffed.</li>
        <li>Bake: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
        <li>Cool: Let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
