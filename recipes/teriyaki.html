    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken teriyaki is a popular Japanese dish featuring tender, 
        marinated chicken cooked in a savory-sweet sauce made from soy sauce, 
        mirin, and sugar. The chicken is often grilled or stir-fried until 
        caramelized and served over rice, garnished with sesame seeds and 
        green onions. Its delightful balance of flavors makes it a favorite 
        in many households.
