# Favorite Recipes by Mondegreen

This repo will feature my favorite recipes that I often use, and is useful for presenting my HTML capabilities that I have learned from The Odin Project. Using links, images, text, I will make a website that is simple but useful enough as a list of recipes. I will also be practicing Git commit messages and how to write them correctly for future reference.

This website will feature:
1. Lists
2. Links
3. Images
4. Modified Texts
